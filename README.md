The dataset DS1 contains 11 activity classes, with some of the classes involving activities that are structurally homogeneous and with others involving activities that are structurally heterogeneous. The DS2 dataset contains 10 homogeneous activity classes and the DS3 dataset contains 10 heterogeneous activity classes. Further experiments involved the DS4 (contains 12 activity classes), DS5 (contains 17 activity classes), and DS6 (contains 9 activity classes) datasets. The activity classes in the DS4 dataset is analogous to DS2, in that they include homogeneous activity categories while activity classes in the DS5 and DS6 are analogous to DS3, in that they include heterogeneous activity classes.
